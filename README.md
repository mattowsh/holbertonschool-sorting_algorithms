## Sorting algorithms
A **sorting algorithm** is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an **order**, either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists (e.g. search algorithms).

The output is a **permutation of the input**: a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements.

For optimum efficiency, **the input data should be stored in a data structure** which allows random access rather than one that allows only sequential access (e.g. an array or doubly linked lists).

## Big O notation
Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives **the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.**

## Learning Objectives
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
